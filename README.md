# next-pyqt

## What is this?
**next-pyqt** is a framework that allows you to make software using pyqt render with basic html and css.

## Where is this right now?
Right now the project handles states, computed properties, methods, events, and props. 
This project as the current state is nowhere near "production usuable". I recommend if you want to use this, copy the repo into a personal one.

## How to install.
1. First clone the git repo by doing `git clone https://github.com/TakumiHendricksDev/next-pyqt.git`
2. Next cd into next pyqt by `cd next-pyqt`
3. Now create a virtual env though whatever preferable means
4. then install all required packaged by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Simply run `python main.py` to start the demo application
